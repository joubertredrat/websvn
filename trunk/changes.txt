CHANGE: The youngest revision of the current directory is now shown by
        default (as opposed to the head revision of the entire repository.
        This means that clicking on a directory will show the lastest 
        changes associated with it. A specific revision can still be
        selected from a log view

1.10/1.10a

There are a few changes to the config file in this release.  Copy
distconfig.inc to config.inc and redo and configuration changes that you
had made.

ADD: WebSVN now caches information on the repositories.  Once a revision
     has been viewed subsequent revisions use the cached infomation to 
     display the directory structure.  This significantly improves the
     browsing speed.
ADD: German language file (thanks to Stephan Stapel)
