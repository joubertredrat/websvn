        This means that clicking on a directory will show the lastest 
        changes associated with it. A specific revision can still be
        selected from a log view

     has been viewed subsequent revisions use the cached infomation to 
     display the directory structure.  This significantly improves the

order to make it more "future proof" and resiliant.  You'll need to copy
distconfig.inc to config.inc redo the appropriate changes are described.

     directories by hand.

FIX: Spaces in Windows path to svnlook and diff are now handled properly
FIX: Calls to external commands such as svnlook no longer require Windows
     style line endings.
